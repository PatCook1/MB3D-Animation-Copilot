Welcome to the Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot!

The Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot facilitates creating animations using the Mandelbulb3D (https://mb3d.overwhale.com) fractal generator. This is done by mapping a game controller or the keys of a standard PC keyboard to the Mandelbulb3D application's Navigator step and angle keys and recording those keyframe movements to a local database. This provides the animation creator with a record of the keyframe movements of an animation project, which in turn facilitates complex animation sequences by allowing the creator to track the movements of previous keyframes to facilitate coordinating subsequent keyframe movements. This help create longer and more complex animation sequences.

The Copilot can also automate keyframe movements with pre-designed move sequences and keyframe replication features. This provides the animation creator sets of pre-made move sequences that are stored in a local database that can be run simply by selecting from a list. This feature assures consistent move sequences, often of which are repetitive.

Because all keyframe movements are stored in a local database the Copilot also facilitates reverting to earlier keyframes as well as modifying keyframe actions in the event that a Mandelbulb3D animation keyframe sequence needs to be corrected. This saves the animation creator from having to start the animation creation over.

This Windows Winforms .NET application is developed, and the open source project managed, by Patrick C. Cook who has been creating with the Mandelbulb3D fractal generator since 2017. With his decades-long background as a professional software developer, Pat set out to address his intention to create longer and more complex animations with the Mandelbulb3D fractal generator.

To use this Copilot application for your own animation projects you will need the following:

1. Windows 10 OS and above (Mac is not supported),
2. The installation of this application,
3. The latest Mandelbulb3D (https://mb3d.overwhale.com) application installed,
4. The JoyToKey (https://joytokey.net/en) application installed,
5. An xBox controller (wired or Bluetooth) or your standard PC keyboard.
